      <h2>Split-level House Files</h2>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>This website is a virtual tribute to the early to mid 2010s. I don't really include the late 2010s (2019, 2020 (Maybe?)) because it just doesn't seem right putting those freak years with the golden years of the 2010s. This year, 2020, has been absolutely terrible. It made me hate mankind. This year is also my last year of middle school. It has been a fun journey. For the most part. You never really realize how good something is until it is gone. As much as I like to think that I should've lived through the 90s, deep down, I know I was born in the right generation, even though my hatred for my own generation is very extreme. Sometimes I just wish I could power on my dusty Xbox 360 and play Skylanders or Minecraft with my friends. It makes me nostalgic just thinking about it. Our society today seems so colorful, but it just seems like there is never any real or genuine emotion or meaning or even a simple message behind anything anymore. It just all seems meaningless sometimes. Anyways, have fun with the Split-level House. I hope it cheers you up or at least brings you some kind of nostalgia.</p>

      <p>Ah, so you've entered the library, eh? Remember those book fairs at school? Which books did you get, Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Big Nate? Personally, I always got the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid book and some others that I still have to this day. One book series still lingers in my mind time to time, especially this year. In fact, I have the full series sitting on the shelf on my desk in front of me at the time of me writing this. The Origami Yoda book series. That book series had so much meaning and relatability you simply cannot find in any fiction book nowadays condensed into non-lengthy books around 150 pages or so. I also remember discovering the Big Nate series in the classroom around second grade. I didn't really think much of it at first, and tossed it aside as a watered down version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Fast forward to fifth grade. During "free periods" (interventions, break times, transition times, special events, etc) my friends and I would gather on the carpet and read Big Nate books on our iPads. I still have fond memories of these books to this day.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I see these very nice clean yards around some parts of my neighborhood. I bike around time to time, and when I do, I usually go the route of where I know these yards are, because the roads tend to also be quite smooth. It is quite a common thing to see trampolines along with these yards; for what reason, I do not know. However, it is my opinion that trampolines were a major part of the early to mid 2010s.</p>

      <p>What a view, am I right? Back in the summer of 2018, right before 6th grade, I remember looking out the window as the sun was setting multiple times throughout the summer, and there was always something about those moments that could never be replicated today. Still, it's nice to have a good view every once in a while.</p>
